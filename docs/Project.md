# Project: "The Museum of Bad Ideas"
A community-driven website showcasing the worst (real or fictional) ideas ever made by developers, designers, or project managers. Think of it as a humorous, slightly satirical collection of tech disasters.

# Purpose
Build a site where users can submit, vote, comment on, and categorize ridiculous ideas, bad decisions, and laughable project concepts.

# Components to Develop

1. **User Submission System**: A feature allowing users to submit their bad ideas, including a title, description, and optional media (images or videos).

2. **Voting Mechanism**: A system for users to upvote or downvote submitted ideas to determine their popularity or hilarity.

3. **Commenting System**: A section for users to discuss and share thoughts on each submitted idea.

4. **Categorization and Tagging**: Tools to categorize and tag ideas for easy navigation and filtering.


# Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Blazor for building interactive and dynamic web UI components.
- **Backend**: .NET 9 for handling server-side logic and API development.
- **Database**: SQL Server for storing user submissions, votes, comments, and other data.

# Example Bad Ideas

1. **Infinite Loading Spinner**: A website feature where the loading spinner never stops, leaving users stuck forever.

2. **Password in Plain Text**: A login system that displays the user's password in plain text on the screen as they type.

3. **Mandatory 10-Second Ads**: A site that forces users to watch a 10-second ad every time they click a button.

4. **404 Page with No Exit**: A 404 error page that has no links or navigation options, effectively trapping the user.

5. **Random Logout Feature**: A system that logs users out at random intervals, regardless of their activity.
